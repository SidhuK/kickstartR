Description: A package to initialize R analysis projects with standardized 
    directory structures and boilerplate files. Supports multiple project 
    templates (analysis, Shiny, targets pipelines), dependency management 
    with renv, automatic license generation, and an interactive setup wizard.
    Creates organized folder hierarchies for data, scripts, outputs, models, 
    and notebooks, along with template files like README.md, .gitignore, 
    and starter R scripts.
